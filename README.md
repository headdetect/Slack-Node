### Building/Running

Running the app is very easy.  
To set it up all you need to run is:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/headdetect/Slack-Node.git
npm install
```
Once you have everything all installed and ready to go, run these commands to get the app up and going:

```shell
gulp  # Use this if you plan on modifying any files
npm run app  # Enter in new tab/window
```
